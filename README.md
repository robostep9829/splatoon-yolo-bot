# **Splatoon 2 & 3 Multiplayer Bot**

This repository contains a bot that can play Splatoon 2 and 3 multiplayer games. The bot uses computer vision to detect the enemy's location on the screen and automatically aims the camera in the appropriate direction. 

The bot uses a pre-trained model to predict the player's location on screen and then sends keyboard inputs to control the camera's rotation. The bot can move the camera in eight different directions using the I, J, K, and L keys.

The bot is built using Python and uses libraries such as [dxcam](https://github.com/ra1nty/DXcam), [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/), and [onnxruntime](https://pypi.org/project/onnxruntime-directml/). The code is designed to run on the Windows operating system and has been tested with Splatoon 2 version ```5.5.1```.

I can share the dataset if you insist.

I'm looking for a convinient way to attach it from my roboflow account to this repo.

## **Gameplay footage needed**

I'm looking for images with ideally 3 or more players. Content with only one player in lower half of the screen is highly discouraged.
